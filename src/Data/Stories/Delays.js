        <p>There may be delays in the set down of matters in the High Court in the last half of this year due to urgent litigation associated with elections.</p>

        <br />
        <p>
        Statutory Instrument 85 of 2023 was issued on 31 May 2023, proclaiming Wednesday the 21st of June as the date on which the nomination court will sit, Wednesday the 23rd of August as the date of the 2023 harmonized elections and Thursday the 2nd of October as the date for a presidential run-off election, if one is necessary.
          <br />
          Our courts function as nomination courts and also preside over any litigation surrounding elections. Following the proclamation of election dates and in terms of the Electoral Act, the Chief Justice has appointed 35 sitting judges of the High Court to the Electoral Court. This means that whereas the said judges continue with their normal work in the High Court, they will prioritize election-matters over any other matters before them.
          <br />
          The High Court will deal with any challenges by prospective candidates whose nomination is turned down by the Nomination Court. After the harmonised elections, the High Court will deal with all election petitions that may be filed. If history repeats itself, we can expect that the High Court will be inundated with elections petitions from the end of August to the end of the year. If this happens, it will necessarily slow down the set down of non-electoral matters that are pending in the High Court.  Clients should take note that there may be delays in the hearing of their matters.

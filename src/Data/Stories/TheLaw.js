      <p>
        On the 16 th of December 2022, the Base Minerals Export Control (Lithium
        Bearing Ores and Unbeneficiated Lithium) Order, 2022 (S.I. 213 of 2022)
        was promulgated.
      </p>
      In brief S.I. 213 of 2022 provided as follows:
      <br />
      <p>
        1. The exportation of unbeneficiated lithium from Zimbabwe was
        prohibited except under the written permit of the Minister of Mines and
        Mining Development.
        <br />
        2. The permit could only be issued under the following circumstances:
        <br />
        i. for the purposes of exporting lithium samples outside Zimbabwe for
        assaying; or
        <br />
        ii. where a miner or lithium exporter provides satisfactory proof that
        exceptional circumstances exist that would justify the exportation of
        unbeneficiated lithium as well as proof that the unbeneficiated lithium
        intended to be exported has been valued in terms of Section 12D of the
        Value Added Tax Act for the purposes of paying the export tax on
        unbeneficiated lithium.
        <br />
        3. The value of the unbeneficiated lithium would either be determined
        using either its market value on the date of exportation with reference
        to a reputable metals exchange or its value as reflected on any document
        required to be delivered in terms of the Customs and Excise Act [
        Chapter 23:02] for its exportation under that act.
        <br />
        4. It reiterates the effect of section 5 of the Base Minerals Export Act
        which makes an order made in terms thereof effective notwithstanding the
        existence of any other inconsistent enactment, trade or custom.
        <br />
        5. Finally, it reiterates section 6 of the Base Minerals Export Act
        which makes failure to comply with an order or with the terms and
        conditions of a permit made in terms of that order. The prescribed
        penalty for the offence was a fine not exceeding level 9 or twice the
        value of the base minerals in respect of which the offence was committed
        or imprisonment for period not exceeding two years or both such fine and
        imprisonment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shortly after the promulgation of S.I. 213 of 2022 came the Base
        Minerals Export Control (Unbeneficiated Base Minerals) Order, 2023 (S.I.
        5 of 2023) which repealed S.I. 213 of 2022 in its entirety.
      </p>
      <p>
        S.I. 5 of 2023 seems to be an attempt to deal more comprehensively with
        the regulation of the exportation of unbeneficiated base mineral ores.
        Like its predecessor S.I. 5 of 2023 prohibits the exportation outside of
        Zimbabwe of unbeneficiated base mineral ores except under the written
        permit of the Minister. It introduces an application procedure for the
        permit and widens the scope of who may apply for the permit to include
        “other interested persons.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It stipulates the following circumstances under which the application
        may be made:
      </p>
      1. Where the applicant produces compelling reasons to the minister showing
      that the unbeneficiated base mineral ore that he intends to export is not
      capable of being beneficiated to any extent within Zimbabwe
      <br />
      2. Where the applicant produces proof satisfactory to the Minister that
      <br />
      i. the unbeneficiated base mineral ore is being exported for assaying
      purposes.
      <br />
      ii. such assay cannot be satisfactorily be done in Zimbabwe; and
      <br />
      iii. the quantity sought be exported is necessary for the purpose of
      assaying.
      <br />
      
      <h2>How to Obtain a Permit </h2>
      <p>
        One assumes that it is easier to obtain a permit to export for assay as
        opposed to exporting for purely commercial reasons. This is because
        exporting for commercial reasons with little or no benefit to the
        Zimbabwe economy is exactly what the regulations are meant to curtail.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no standard form to be used in the application which must be
        directed to the Minister of Mines and Mining Development. This can be
        done by means of a letter attaching all documents that the miner
        considers necessary for the success of the application. There are no
        guidelines on what the Minister will consider but it is likely that the
        extent to which the applicant company is engaged in corporate social
        responsibility activities that benefit the locals and the economy and an
        undertaking that the proceeds from the export will be channelled to
        Zimbabwe with only profits being repatriated in terms of the Exchange
        Control legislation. At the end of the day, the minister exercises his
        discretion, and his decision must be accompanied by reasons as required
        under administrative law.
      </p>
      <p>
        The regulations are couched in a manner that suggests that the
        application is determined “on the papers” but there is always room for
        clients to request to make oral representations. It is advisable to do
        so as this will present client with a chance to speed up the process and
        clear up any issues that may not be apparent from the application. There
        are no timelines, and the turnaround times will depend on how much the
        client pushes for a decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        After obtaining a waiver from the Minister an application for an export
        permit must then be submitted to the Mineral Marketing Corporation. A
        fee of USD 1000-00 must accompany the application. Local media has
        reported that only the Zimbabwe Defence Industries has been granted the
        permit. There is no public information on the number of permits issued
        so far.
      </p>
     
      <h2>Impact on Mining Business in Zimbabwe</h2>
      <p>
        The minerals and metal sector in Africa is heavily affected by export
        control measures of raw materials. Export control measures are amongst
        the tools which governments employ with the aim to encourage local
        processing and capture more of the value flowing from minerals
        extraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        By putting restraints on the export of raw materials, governments hope
        to divert these materials to the domestic market, thereby supporting
        local activities to process these materials and employment. However,
        export restrictions can also have costs for the countries employing
        them; in particular, they can lower the returns on raw materials
        production and entail efficiency costs for the economy overall.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017 the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development
        published a report on Export Controls and Competitiveness in African
        Mining and Minerals Processing Industries. 1 The four case studies
        selected for the analysis in the report concerned the manganese sector
        in Gabon, the primary and secondary lead sector in South Africa, the
        copper sector in Zambia and the chromium sector in Zimbabwe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The report describes developments in the industries over a 20-year time
        span from 1992 through to 2013. It examines the revealed comparative
        advantages and disadvantages of mineral export controls and determined
        whether changes have occurred in the relative competitiveness of raw and
        related processed products and whether these could be attributed to
        export control measures. The focus of the analysis was on the effect of
        export controls on mineral processing at the initial stages of the value
        chains of these industries, which we suspect is also the primary focus
        of of S.I. 5 of 2023 given the nascence of beneficiation in general in
        the mining industry. The overall result of the analysis in the report
        finds that export control measures may have had an adverse effect on the
        mining industries in Africa and that the correspondent processing
        industries have not benefited but have rather been stunted as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary reason for this is that, on the one hand the respective
        export control measures had a limiting effect on the capacity of each
        subject country to keep up with global demand for its raw minerals, thus
        leaving opportunity for competitor countries without similar
        restrictions to fill the gap, as it were . On the other hand, the
        products of the subject country’s local downstream processing industries
        failed to compete on the global market with products from far more
        advanced countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another reason identified in the report for the negative effect of
        export controls which directly related to the chromium export ban in
        Zimbabwe was the lack of a local market to which producers of raw
        chromite could sell. It is reported that when the ban was introduced
        producers of chromite ore had difficulties finding local processors.
        Unable to sell abroad and locally, some mining operations closed down
        completely. The report states that this was not in the interest of the
        Zimbabwean economy, which depends on the mining sector for foreign
        exchange, and not a circumstance that the government appears to have
        thought of when it imposed the export ban – the strictest of all export
        control measures –hoping to attract investment in the country’s smelting
        capacity and further up the value chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lesson to be gleaned from the above is that a local market for raw
        base minerals will need to be cultivated and incentivized in order for
        the new measures to have a positive impact in the mining industry in
        Zimbabwe. At the same time it will be important to ensure that the
        nation’s capacity to meet global demand for its raw minerals is not
        unduly limited in the short to medium term while the local market grows.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, it remains to be seen whether this new measure will be
        advantageous for the mining sector of Zimbabwe, especially for further
        down the value chain of mineral processing.
